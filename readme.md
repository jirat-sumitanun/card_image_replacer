# Problem found

If replace image is not PNG image from the beginning.

a few card may have a problem with KoikatuDragAndDrop plugin.

Dropped character not load but can replace with existed character in studio.

or You need to load it with game or studio menu.

So I suggest you to Convert it into PNG with software like Format Factory. (I tested, it work).

in case you want to drag and drop it.

issue maybe come from convert image code that can't be fix.
